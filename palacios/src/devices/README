This is how devices are hooked into the system:
This is very similar to Linux Modules and device drivers.


Devices are kept in their own directory structure: 
SOURCE => src/devices
HEADERS => include/devices


Each device implements the following:
 * a create_[device] function that returns a (struct vm_device *).
 * a set of operations found in (struct vm_device_ops).
	(currently only init and deinit are called, the rest are not fully thought out...)

The control flow goes like this:

1. The VMM calls create_[device]() which returns a (struct vm_device *). 

2. This function calls create_device(char *name, struct vm_device_ops * ops, void * private_data);
 * The arguments are device specific, and the pointer is returned to the VMM. No instance 
	specific initialization should be done here

3. The VMM then calls attach_device(struct guest_info * vm, struct vm_device * dev) to associate the 
	device with a virtual machine

4. attach_device then calls the ops->init() function found in the (struct vm_device *)
 * This init function is where all the instance specific initialization is done. A pointer to the virtual machine
	the device is associated with is stored in vm_device->vm.
 * Any event hooks should be done here.



Disconnection goes like this: 

1. The VMM calls unattach_device(struct vm_device * dev)

2. unattach_device calls the ops->deinit() function found in the (struct vm_device *)
 * All the instance specific deinitialization should be done here
 * Any event hooks that were taken should be released

3. The VMM then calls free_device(struct vm_device * dev);
