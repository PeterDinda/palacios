/* Overview 
 *
 * Time handling in VMMs is challenging, and Palacios uses the highest 
 * resolution, lowest overhead timer on modern CPUs that it can - the 
 * processor timestamp counter (TSC). Note that on somewhat old processors
 * this can be problematic; in particular, older AMD processors did not 
 * have a constant rate timestamp counter in the face of power management
 * events. However, the latest Intel and AMD CPUs all do (should...) have a 
 * constant rate TSC, and Palacios relies on this fact.
 * 
 * Basically, Palacios keeps track of three quantities as it runs to manage
 * the passage of time:
 * (1) The host timestamp counter - read directly from HW and never written
 * (2) A monotonic guest timestamp counter used to measure the progression of
 *     time in the guest. This is computed using an offsets from (1) above.
 * (3) The actual guest timestamp counter (which can be written by
 *     writing to the guest TSC MSR - MSR 0x10) from the monotonic guest TSC.
 *     This is also computed as an offset from (2) above when the TSC and
 *     this offset is updated when the TSC MSR is written.
 *
 * The value used to offset the guest TSC from the host TSC is the *sum* of all
 * of these offsets (2 and 3) above
 * 
 * Because all other devices are slaved off of the passage of time in the guest,
 * it is (2) above that drives the firing of other timers in the guest, 
 * including timer devices such as the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT).
 *
 * Future additions:
 * (1) Add support for temporarily skewing guest time off of where it should
 *     be to support slack simulation of guests. The idea is that simulators
 *     set this skew to be the difference between how much time passed for a 
 *     simulated feature and a real implementation of that feature, making 
 *     pass at a different rate from real time on this core. The VMM will then
 *     attempt to move this skew back towards 0 subject to resolution/accuracy
 *     constraints from various system timers.
 *   
 *     The main effort in doing this will be to get accuracy/resolution 
 *     information from each local timer and to use this to bound how much skew
 *     is removed on each exit.
