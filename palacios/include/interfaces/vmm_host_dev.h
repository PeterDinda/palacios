/*

  The purpose of this interface is to make it possible to implement
  virtual devices in the host OS.   It is intended to be used by 
  passthrough device implementations, such as the generic device 
  and the PCI front-end device.  

  One use of this interface, and the generic and PCI passthrough devices
  might be to build an interface with simulated devices in QEMU, SST, etc
  under a Linux host.  That scenario would look like this:

Guest config:

  generic device:
    <device class="generic" id="mydev" forward="host_device" hostdev="url" >
       ports, memory regions, interrupts set with PASSTHROUGH option 
    </device>

  PCI front devive:
    <device class="pci_front" id="mydev", hostdev="url">
       vendor and device ids, etc
    </device>


Host (Linux) side:

    There would be an implementation and registration of the hooks 
    defined and explained in this file

    The implementation might, for example, create an interface to 
    a user space process, for example like the console 
    (palacios-console.[ch] + v3_cons.c) or graphics console
    (palacios-graphics-console.[ch] + v3_vncserver.c) do
    and route the hook functions defined here through it. 
    Through this interface, the calls could be routed to an SST
    device module.
