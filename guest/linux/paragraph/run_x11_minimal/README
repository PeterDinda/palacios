Notes:
    - The compiled X11 directory contains a copy of all the libraries that my-microcore-con guest needs to run X. 
      These libraries are in x11/build/bin/ and x11/build/lib/
      If you're running a more "advanced" guest, you may not need the libraries and you should edit the setup script accordingly (remove the commands that copy libraries).
    
    - To test X11 on the microcore guest:
         mount x11 as a FILEDISK device into the guest (x11.dat contains all the x11 source files and the setup script, see my-microcore-con.xml) 
         
         In the host: 
            run the vncserver and client.
        
         In the guest: 
            type the following commands:
            1. mkdir new-x11/
            2. sudo mount /dev/hdb/ new-x11/
            3. source ./setup.sh
            4. cd x11/build/bin/
            5. sudo ./startx -- -config xorg.conf & 
        xclock and 3 xterms should be visible in the vncclient window.
