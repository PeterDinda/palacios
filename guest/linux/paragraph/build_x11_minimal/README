To build the X11 universe on this machine (Parkinson-11):

cd /opt/x11/src
./doit.sh

the file "mymods.txt" are the modules you want built 
and the file "myautoresume.txt" is how far you've gotten up to this point

I have set this up so that it compiles, and it currently is all
compiled.


To build the universe on some other machine:

- you will find a copy of everything in /441/pdinda/x11,
  which should be identical to that in /opt/x11 - this includes
  my changes to make it work

- if you compile from /441 on a parkinson machine, make
  sure the files you create are actually owner root.  
  /etc/idmapd must contain:

Nobody-User = root
Nobody-Group = nobody

- you need to install the following tools:

yum install llvm llvm-devel
yum install libudev libudev-devel
yum install mtdev mtdev-devel

- use the general instructions in http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModularDevelopersGuide

- make sure that you skip xf86-video-newport xf86-video-sis and other 
  drivers that depend on xaa 

- remove include of mibstore.h for anything that includes it

mkdir -p /opt/x11/src
cd /opt/x11/src
git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/util/modular util/modular

cd /opt/x11/src
./util/modular/build.sh --clone --autoresume myautoresume.txt /opt/x11/build

This will 
  - clone package repositories as needed
  - resume execution on a build failure if you rerrun it
  - put its output in /opt/x11/build

Also of note:

./util/modular/build.sh -L /opt/x11/build > mymods.txt

This will give you a list of the available modules to build.  You
can then edit this file (mymods.txt) and build just those modules i
you want using:

./util/modular/build.sh --clone --autoresume myautoresume.txt --modfile mymods.txt /opt/x11/build
