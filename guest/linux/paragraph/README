This directory contains guest side code to use the in-progress
PARAGRAPH paravirtualized graphics card within a Linux guest, either
directly from a command-line testing tool or via X11.  

It also contains information about how to build a minimal instance of 
X11 and then run it within a minimal guest.   This is desirable for
testing.

README              - this file

write_paragraph     - manipulate PARAGRAPH from guest without X11

x11.patch           - modify X11 dummy driver and config files to
                      output to PARAGRAPH

x11_modified_files/ - X11 files that have been added/altered for 
                      configuring X with PARAGRAPH (basically all
                      the files touched by x11.patch)

build_x11_minimal/  - how to actually build X11 without poking a
                      stick in your eye

run_x11_minimal/    - how to run your X11 in a tiny guest 
                      (microcore-based)


The level of functionality here is sufficient to bring up
a basic X11 session and launch xclocks and xterms.

Note that some documentation refers to "x11/".  This is the 
built X11 image, which should be burned into a virtual disk:

1. Use dd to create a disk file
2. Use mkfs to build a filessytem on it
3. Use loopback mount to attach disk and
   copy your x11 setup and needed shared libraries to it.
4. Unmount
5. Use disk file in your Palacios guest (via FILEDISK).

For NU folks, this image is also sitting in /v-test/paragraph.
